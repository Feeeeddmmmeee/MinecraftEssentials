## Minecraft Essentials is a mod focusing on improving your overall experience by adding mechanics essential to do so.
Currently it adds Blood Moons, Solar Eclipses and a few new tool types. Events are highly inspired by those implemented 
in Terraria and by CorgiTaco's [Enhanced-Celestials](https://github.com/CorgiTaco/Enhanced-Celestials).

## Currently added:

### Battle Axes
Battle axes can be crafted using 5 of a given material and two sticks (excluding the netherite version that is crafted using a netherite ingot and a 
diamond battle axe at a smithing table).

### Daggers
Daggers are a new type of tools that can be crafted using 3 of a given material, a stick and a fermented spider eye. The eye represents an ingredient essential to craft the invisibility potion. A person holding a dagger in their main hand becomes invisible until they attack an entity. The first attack deals additional 10 damage (so netherite daggers deal a total of **17** damage on the first hit, however note that all the attacks performed during the next minute will deal 7 damage and you will not be invisible anymore).

### Blood Moons
Blood Moons have a 15% chance of occuring each night at 13001 time in Mnecraft ticks. They disappear after worlds time turns back to day. During Blood Moons 
all damage sources (except magic) cause the player to bleed for 3 seconds. The moon and your screen turn red. They're indicated by a chat 
message `The Blood Moon is rising...`. After the messasge you will be unable to sleep until the next morning.

### Solar Eclipses
They have an 8% chance of occuring each morning starting at 0 in Minecraft ticks. Solar Eclipses stay in your world until the next evening. While a Solar Eclipse is present 
mobs that would burn in normal conditions are immune to the sun and can attack you. If a thunderstorm accurs during a Solar Eclipse the player will be unable to sleep. The whole day is slightly darker and the sun has a different texture. Indicated by a chat message `A Solar Eclipse is happening!`.

### Commands
If you want to just play with the events you can use some new commands. All commands start with `/event` and the second argument may be one of the following:
- bloodmoon - starts a new Blood Moon event. Note that it will only work at night.
- solareclipse - starts a new Solar Eclipse, works properly only during the day.
- clear - clears the current event, however if you want to change from an eclipse to a blood moon you don't have to use this one as they just overwrite each other.

## To be added:

### I decided to keep the mod in a vanilla+ style so some of the features mentioned in previous updates will not be added. 

### Feel free to suggest anything, but the current objectives are:
- Curses. A new type of an enchantement thats decreases the stats or differently affects the player.
- Adding a new, powerful ore (Optional). Minecraft itself lacks the ability to oneshot mobs with end game gear.

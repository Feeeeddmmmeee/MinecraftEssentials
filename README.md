## Minecraft Essentials is a mod focusing on improving your overall experience by adding mechanics essential to do so.
Currently it adds Blood Moons, Solar Eclipses (WIP, Doesn't update any textures yet) and battle axes. Events are highly inspired by those implemented 
in terraria and by CorgiTaco's [Enhanced-Celestials](https://github.com/CorgiTaco/Enhanced-Celestials).

## Currently added:

### Battle Axes
Battle axes can be crafted using 5 of a given material and two sticks (excluding the netherite version that is crafted using a netherite ingot and a 
diamond battle axe at a smithing table).

### Blood Moons
Blood Moons have a 5% chance of occuring each night at 13001 time in Mnecraft ticks. They disappear after worlds time turns back to day. During Blood Moons 
all damage sources (except magic) cause the player to bleed for 3 seconds. The moon and your screen turn red. They're indicated by a chat 
message `The Blood Moon is rising...`. After the messasge you will be unable to sleep until the next morning.

### Solar Eclipses (Not 100% complete yet)
They have a 5% chance of occuring each morning starting at 0 in Minecraft ticks. Solar Eclipses stay in your world until the next evening. While a Solar Eclipse is present 
mobs that would burn in normal conditions are immune to the sun and can attack you. If a thunderstorm accurs during a Solar Eclipse the play will be unable to sleep. 

## To be added:

### Event Summoning items
Items with a low chance of being dropped during an event and summoning it again if used in proper conditions.

### Different textures during Solar Eclipses
A different for the sun indicating that a Solar Eclipse is present and a slightly darker sky texture.

### More items
For example powerful, obtainable during the events only, weapons or other items.

### Bosses?
Maybe custom event bosses/enemies, a slight chance of a boss (wither) being spawned each night.
